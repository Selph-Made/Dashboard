This directory is for the user to place files inside of. These files will be visible to the dashboard server application program. You could potentially treat it the same as an upload directory. Mind the server generated file directories, like the one for notes [as noted by the (dashboard/user/notes)] where your notes are saved in the rich text format. This acts as a backup for saving your notes if the database gets corrupted.
